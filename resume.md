# Research experience

* 09, 2019- 12, 2019: Using Google Earth and Remote Sensing to find Indian Paths

  _Use Google Earth and remote sensing image to find the road built by the Indians recorded in the book, Use Arcmap to reproduce these roads and determine where they go and where they pass, to better study Indian history and culture._


* 04, 2019-05, 2019: Determine the Area Affected by Airport Noise using Python

  _Use Python Script and Arcmap to establish a multi-level buffer model for airport noise in York County to analyze its impact range and mechanism._


* 04, 2019: Use Drones to Study the local river

  _To construct the hydrological model, we use drones to obtain high-precision data in the river basin, and then obtain digital elevation model and digital orthophotos through data processing. We also use drones to dynamically monitor the water levels of selected river basins._


* 03, 2019-05, 2019: The Conflicts and Integration between Chinese and American Cultures in the ABC Group

  _Use narrative research method to understand and explain the conflicts and integration between Chinese and American cultures in the ABC group by exploring the growth experiences of an ABC individual._


* 10, 2018-12, 2018: Using Crowdsourcing to find women in GIS

  _Use crowdsourced data to find women working in the GIS field, explore their spatial distribution and make an interactive web map._
